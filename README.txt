Project: Jointed Figure
by Tyler Edwards 
FUTURE PROJECT

Description: Design, model, and print the pieces to a figure that can be pieced together using joints.

Software: Autodesk Fusion, PrusaSlicer
Material: PLA Filament

Reason: I wanted to test my ability to design things in Fusion and thought that creating a figure with joints would provide a fun challenge since the measurements and design would neeed to be very precise in order for it to funciton properly. 

Plan: 
        1. Research how joints function on different figures (the ammount of space needed, etc.).
        2. Sketch a basic design for the figure.
        3. Make a more detailed design with the needed measurements.
        4. Model the pieces and ensure they fit together in Fusion360.
        5. Slice and print the pieces all together. 
        6. See if the pieces fit together to form the figure. 
        6. Make any necessaary adjustments to the desisgn.
        7. Repeat until the pieces fit together properly and the figure will stay together.
